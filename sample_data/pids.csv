PID,Name,Units,Why it Matters
0D,Vehicle Speed,km/h or mph,Core metric for route profiling
0C,Engine RPM,rev/min,High RPM = more fuel use
11,Throttle Position,%,Shows acceleration behavior
10,Mass Air Flow (MAF),grams/sec,Used to calculate fuel usage
5E,Fuel Rate,L/h or gal/h,Direct measure of fuel consumption (if supported)
04,Engine Load,%,Indicates engine effort
05,Coolant Temp,째C or 째F,Helps understand warm-up phase fuel use
0F,Intake Air Temp,째C or 째F,Affects combustion efficiency
0B,Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP),kPa,Used with RPM to estimate engine airflow
06,Fuel Trim (Short Term),%,Shows how much ECU is adjusting fuel delivery
07,Fuel Trim (Long Term),%,Shows how much ECU is adjusting fuel delivery
2F,Fuel Level Input,%,Helps track tank usage and estimate range
